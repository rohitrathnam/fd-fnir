# Prototype Instrumentation for Frequency Domain fNIRS

## Abstract

Frequency domain fNIRS is a tissue optical measurement technique used to measure
absolute haemoglobin concentrations in brain tissue. This work is intended to
be the first step in the development of a wearable, low-cost FD-fNIRS device for
neurofeedback applications. The system requirements were generated from a review
of relevant literature. A simplified system architecture was developed based on the
various instrumentation methodologies proposed by various authors. The functional
blocks of this system were prototyped and their performance was evaluated. The
developed VCSEL current source was found to have a span of 10uA which meets the
design specifications. However, challenges exist in optimally biasing SiPM, which is
susceptible to optical and electronic noise sources.
